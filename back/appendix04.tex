\appendix{D}{Group-Specific Event Studies}
\label{complete_group_time_att_dynamics}
Applying \cite{callaway2021difference}'s approach involves estimating the ATT for each treatment-timing group and calendar month. Then, a family of causal parameters of interest can be obtained, which can be aggregated through Equation \ref{eq:event_aggregation} to recover the event study. In the main text, we present the event-study-like results, which are based on the aggregated ATT by the number of months after the treatment. One might wonder if there are heterogeneous treatment effects across different treatment-timing groups so we include the complete group-time ATT here for father discussions.

Through the following set of figures, we can generally claim that there is no substantial heterogeneous treatment effects across different treatment-timing groups as there is no particular group exhibit distinct ATT dynamics compared to the others in any of the outcome. However, there is an exception, which is ATT of residential shift on outgoing contact distance in group 7 (see Figure \ref{fig:attgt_residential_shift_mobile_communication_network}). In such case, only group 7 shows a significant positive effect contemporaneously with the treatment while all the other groups exhibit insignificant effects. However, all the others are, in fact, experience a positive upward shift in outcomes, which coincides with the group 7 and therefore, we can still somehow confirm the positive effect of residential shift on outgoing contact distance.
